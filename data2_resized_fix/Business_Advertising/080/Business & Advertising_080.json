Retaining the largest and most prominent texts, 'CAFE' and 'HARD,' is sufficient to effectively convey the core attributes of the place as a café and its brand name. On this basis, adding 'ENTRANCE' at the store entrance can provide a clear spatial guide for the image, eliminating confusion caused by the original cluttered information, thereby enhancing the functional directive and visual clarity of the composition."
