        "knowledge_prompt": "The title 'Vurtual reallity and viedo gams' should be corrected to 'Virtual reality and video games' because each original word contains a specific spelling error: 'Vurtual' uses the wrong vowel letter sequence and should be 'Virtual'; 'reallity' has an extra 'l' and should be 'reality'; 'viedo' has a transposed letter pair and should be 'video'; 'gams' is missing the vowel 'e' and should be 'games'. These corrections restore standard English spelling, preserve the intended meaning, and improve readability and professionalism."
