"knowledge_prompt": "The task involves removing one of the words in a bold, all-caps typographic composition while preserving layout balance and visual hierarchy. The model must maintain vertical alignment and spacing harmony so that 'FOOD' and 'FRAGILE' remain visually centered. Recognizing that the deletion changes the semantic meaning from 'food delivery service' to 'food handling notice' helps preserve the intended design integrity."
