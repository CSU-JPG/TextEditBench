        "knowledge_prompt":"When the country information on a passport needs to be changed from the United States to the United Kingdom, its visual elements must be adjusted accordingly to maintain consistency in national identity. The bald eagle symbol of the United States represents its national sovereignty, while the British passport features the Royal Coat of Arms, depicting the 'lion and unicorn supporting the shield,' as its official emblem. At the same time, replacing the background map from U.S. territory to a map of the U.K. further reinforces the change in national identity from a geographical perspective. This comprehensive visual alignment ensures the internal coherence and authority of the passport as an official national document, preventing confusion in identity recognition caused by mixed elements."
