        "knowledge_prompt": "The multiple repeated arrangements of the 'STOP' signs in the image make the visual presentation monotonous and lacking in dynamic variation, which can easily reduce the viewer's attention and interest. To enhance the image's appeal, differentiating the 'STOP' elements on the left and right sides (such as introducing symbol or icon variations) can break the repetitive pattern and inject visual vitality. At the same time, since these modifications still revolve around the traffic control theme, they ensure that the core function of 'stop' is not deviated from, thereby maintaining semantic consistency and recognizability while improving attractiveness."
