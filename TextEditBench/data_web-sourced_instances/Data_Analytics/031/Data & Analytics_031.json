This ambiguity can affect the accurate understanding of the amount. To eliminate confusion, adding a widely recognized currency symbol (such as the US dollar sign '$') before the amounts can provide a consistent and clear unit indicator for all monetary entries, thereby enhancing the standardization and readability of the receipt, making it clearly understood by audiences in different regions."
