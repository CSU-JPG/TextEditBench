        "knowledge_prompt": "If the image displays a 'Closed' sign, it clearly conveys that the store has ceased operations. In real-life situations, a closed store is usually characterized by the interior lights being turned off (creating a dim atmosphere) and the entrance being locked. These visual cues together reinforce the sense of the store being non-operational. If the current scene lacks these accompanying elements, it would create a logical disconnect with the 'Closed' sign, weakening the scene's credibility. Therefore, by simultaneously adjusting the lighting and adding a door lock, the visual representation can align with the textual information, thereby establishing an internally coherent and cognitively consistent 'closed' scenario."
