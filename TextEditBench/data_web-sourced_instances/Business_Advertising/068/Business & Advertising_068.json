Therefore, modifying the text to 'horseshoe bar' can directly utilize the key visual symbol in the image (the horseshoe) and associate it with a clear commercial setting (a bar), thereby establishing a clear and intuitive image-text correspondence and effectively conveying the nature and theme of the place."
