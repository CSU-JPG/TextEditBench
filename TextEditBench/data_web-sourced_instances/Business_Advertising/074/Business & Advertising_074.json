Using the term 'store' is too broad and fails to highlight its professional nature; changing it to 'bakery' can accurately capture the essence of its business, enhance its appeal, and provide viewers with the most direct and precise scene information, thereby effectively eliminating ambiguity and reinforcing the consistency between the image and text."
