        "knowledge_prompt": "A billboard in a road scene that only displays the word 'Republic' would appear abrupt and ambiguous, because the term itself is an abstract political concept, lacking a specific context, which can easily confuse viewers. Modifying it to a slogan with a call to action, such as 'Build Our Republic,' can transform the image into a scene of political propaganda or a collective appeal. This not only gives the word 'Republic' a clear context and intention for action, but also makes the billboard's presence in the public space of the road more reasonable and narratively coherent."
